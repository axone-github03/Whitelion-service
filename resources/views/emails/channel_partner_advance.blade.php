<p>Dear {{$params['firm_name']}},</p>

<p>We hope this email finds you well. We would like to inform you that due to recently missed payment dates, we will be shifting from credit to advance payments for all future orders. We understand that this may be an inconvenience, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>
<p>Please be aware that effective immediately, all orders will require 100% advance payment. We understand that this may require some adjustments on your end, and we will work with you to make the transition as smooth as possible.</p>
<p>We value your partnership and appreciate your continued support. We are confident that this change will lead to improved financial stability for both of our companies. We look forward to continuing our successful partnership and achieving great things together.</p>
If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us. We are always here to help.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
    Whitelion Systems Pvt Ltd,</p>
